# Demo data

Development seed tooling, fixtures, artwork, and tests live in
`apps/cms/scripts/seed/`, separate from application source in `apps/cms/src/`.
The CLI imports the real Payload configuration so generated records follow the
same schema and validation as editorial content. Application code does not import
seed tooling; Faker and the script runner remain development dependencies.

The curated TypeScript seed uses Payload's Local API to create one six-language
workshop, artwork with localized alternative text, and a Persian poem with explicit
German and English translations. Automatic seeding checks authors, media, pages,
poems, and events and skips the database if any contain records. User accounts
are excluded from this emptiness check.

All writes share one PostgreSQL transaction. A failure rolls back records and
removes only files belonging to that attempt. Existing editorial files and records
are preserved. Avoid simultaneous first-time setup against the same database.
You can explicitly run `pnpm --filter @poetry/cms seed` to fill missing demo records;
it does not update existing records or repair an older partial translation set.

See [migrations and local data](migrations.md) before transferring a database
or uploads.

### Optional bulk demo data

Run `pnpm --filter @poetry/cms seed:bulk` from the repository root to add 60
fictional authors, 300 poems, 100 workshops, and 12 local SVG
artwork assets. Start PostgreSQL first with `docker compose up -d postgres`.
This separate command does not change the small automatic startup seed.

The bulk command only accepts a local `poetry` database and refuses production.
It writes through Payload in one transaction, rolls back on failure, and removes
only uploads from the failed attempt. Repeat runs skip existing demo records,
including drafts, without updating or deleting editorial content. Do not run seeds
concurrently. Keep the `bulk-demo-v1` identifiers in demo names, slugs, and artwork
credits if you want later runs to recognize those records.

Faker supplies localized fictional names and fixed-range workshop dates. Its
version and random seeds are pinned. Six-language editorial fixtures supply
matching demo poem translations and workshop prose; they are illustrative writing,
not real poems or reviewed publication translations. Some poems have no
translations, others have up to five. Workshop, page, and biography translations
are intentionally incomplete in some records. One in five poems and workshops is
a draft; text lengths, artwork relationships, and past/future dates vary. Workshops
are marked `noIndex` and omit registration links. No users or credentials are seeded.

### Optional event photographs (no API key)

Run `pnpm --filter @poetry/cms seed:photos` to prepare the bulk dataset and import
12 JPEG photographs of poetry events from Wikimedia Commons' public API. This
free service requires no API key. The ordinary startup and `seed:bulk` commands remain offline
with respect to image services.

The importer searches for poetry readings, selects a repeatable sample, and
accepts only photos with an author, source page, and CC BY or CC BY-SA license.
It saves source title, photographer, license, source link, license link, and a
resizing/cropping notice in each media credit. Credits remain stored in CMS media metadata. Localized alternative text describes its illustrative purpose.

The command upgrades only seed artwork on bulk demo workshops, keeps intentionally
image-free fixtures, and preserves editor-chosen images and draft/published status.
Downloaded originals and Payload-generated sizes live in `apps/cms/media/`.
Repeat runs reuse the cached 12 media records without image API requests; do not
rename their `bulk-demo-v1-commons-photo-*` filenames. API failures stop the photo
import rather than silently changing images. Database writes share a transaction;
a failure rolls back attachments and removes only that attempt's files. Photo
imports and the preceding bulk dataset preparation are separate transactions.

Sanitized production snapshots remain a later milestone. A populated imported
database already bypasses automatic demo seeding.

## Homepage starting content

Run `pnpm seed:homepage` in `apps/cms` with PostgreSQL available. It creates the
homepage only if no saved homepage exists, using existing published records and
the six translated starting texts. It never replaces an existing homepage.
Review the initial content before using it outside the local prototype.

Invitation, support, and newsletter links initially point to the existing Poetry
Project website. Editors can replace them in the homepage sections. See
[homepage editing](homepage-editing.md) for the controls.

## Fixed informational page starting content

Run `pnpm seed:pages` in `apps/cms` to import the German and English
About, Contact, Privacy, and Legal Notice content. This replaces those two locales
for the four globals in one transaction and preserves other translations. Existing
versions retain the previous content. The command refuses production.
